# Class-room-student-counting-using-Arduino-UNO

This project is used in most colleges to count the number of students available in the classroom. Here, we haven't  used any ML algorithms. 

# Introduction 

This energy-efficient system uses InfraRed (IR) sensor pairs to count students entering or leaving a classroom, helping teachers take attendance. Here's how it works:
             IR sensor pairs detect students entering or leaving the classroom.
             The microcontroller (Arduino-UNO) processes the input and increments/decrements a counter accordingly.
             The count is displayed on a 7-segment display for arrivals and a 16x2 display for total attendance.
